I am currently in charge of creating the package installer for Metonator's Need For Speed World Game Launcher.
I am not in charge nor part of the Game Launcher development, I;m just in charge of making a professional installer.
Here you could view all of the installer hot fixes or early deployment updates.
I do quality assurance for the package installers for bugs before there released.
I also added an package updater along side with Metonator's Updater.
If there is any package installer bugs please report it in the issue tab.
Thanks and Happy Racing. :D
